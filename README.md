# "Introduction to Database Management Systems"  

This homework assignment consists of two independent tasks. It might seem a bit extensive, but there’s no need to worry — I’ve included detailed hints and recommendations to guide me through the process.  

---

## What I'll Accomplish:

1. **Create a database** for a task management system using PostgreSQL and perform the required queries in the task management database.
2. **Develop a Python script** that utilizes the PyMongo library to implement basic operations in MongoDB.

By completing this assignment, I’ll:

- Reinforce my knowledge of working with SQL and gain a deeper understanding of various interactions with relational databases, including selection, updates, insertions, and data analysis.
- Learn how to use PyMongo methods to interact with a cloud-based MongoDB server via a Python script.  

Let’s get started! 💪🏼
